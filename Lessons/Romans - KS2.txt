Due to their religion, Romans hated christians, and often tortured and killed them. That was, until, Constantine became emporer, and announced Christianity as the new main Roman religion.
Constantine also had a city in modern-day Turkey named after him, called Constantinople. Nowadays, it is known is Istanbul.
--Q What was the original name of Istanbul?
constantinople
Around this time, Rome was beggining to fall apart. Citizens were running out of money, and many neighbouring tribes began attacking.
In an attempt to make the empire survive, it was split into two countries - Western Rome, which was based in Rome, and Eastern Rome, based in Constantinople. However, the empire eventually perished, and Europe, having benifited from the Roman's technology, fell into a "dark age", as they no longer had Rome to help them.
